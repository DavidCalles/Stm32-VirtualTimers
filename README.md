# Stm32-VirtualTimers
Virtual timers through Tim3 in STM32F411RE.

This applciation enables the creation of many timers with a common time-base through a set of structures and functions to modify them.
The implementation uses the HAL drivers for the specific STM board.

In addition, a command parser has been implemented so the interfacing with the board can be done directly into the serial terminal.
